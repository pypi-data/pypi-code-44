""" See this to build an executable:

"""Building the package:
pythonw setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
#tar tzf dist/*.gz
pythonw -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pyjamas

or

pythonw -m twine upload dist/*

# To install, open a new terminal (not within pycharm) and do:
pip3.6 uninstall pyjamas-rfglab
pip3.6 install pyjamas-rfglab

To fill in the install_requires field below, try pipreqs pyjamas from the src/pyjamas folder.
NOTE: When installing a package from testPyPI, the dependencies are also installed from there.
So you will get package not found errors.

NOTE 2: Windows installation should be after installing CONDA, and "conda install shapely=1.6.4". This also installs
geos (C library used by shapely) 3.7.1. Unfortunately geos is only available up to version 0.2.1 in pypi.
Alternatively, there are shapely wheels at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely.
